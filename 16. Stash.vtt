Hey and welcome again to the tutorial of master engage and get her in this video where we learn about

00:08.040 --> 00:13.820
an important come engage her which is Dutch what she sturgeon and what a win.

00:14.070 --> 00:15.250
What does it do.

00:15.270 --> 00:23.820
So for example if I'm walking on down to Cambridge or immediately for example and the software engineer

00:23.820 --> 00:29.500
lead or for example a client won't just see want to see something or what.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.980
Just want to have a watch.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.730
For example to read imagery I just see it.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.080
Let's see.

00:37.270 --> 00:46.370
Let's just say that I work in a company and I'm a developer and software program and only want wants

00:46.380 --> 00:50.990
me to give him this fine raise me tree and I'm not.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.940
And I'm still working on it.

00:52.950 --> 01:02.650
For example let's say that it's just Cary think of something

01:07.150 --> 01:08.190
creation of something.

01:08.220 --> 01:08.670
Yeah.

01:08.770 --> 01:19.000
So now if you want to come in third for example and just say get stages you will see that it tells us

01:19.000 --> 01:19.630
that.

01:20.090 --> 01:21.940
Jeremy Jay has been updated.

01:22.390 --> 01:30.090
But what if I want I want to give him a I want to give him loads away Dimitri but with all the verse

01:30.090 --> 01:33.550
and not with just a word just update.

01:33.590 --> 01:35.700
And here comes the role of.

01:36.250 --> 01:47.440
Just come on get stuff so let's try it get those hit enter and tell us is it's safe to work diligently

01:47.650 --> 01:52.360
and we see that the last thing that we does it it's disappeared.

01:52.360 --> 02:01.880
So now if we do indicate status it tells us does everything is work clean and fine.

02:01.930 --> 02:03.490
So now everything work clean.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.410
I wouldn't give it.

02:04.510 --> 02:08.840
Despite the region which lead to the to the software engineer.

02:09.800 --> 02:16.720
But now you want to I want to continue on my work so I need to uh.

02:17.860 --> 02:21.780
So I will need to continue what they was doing here and the code.

02:22.210 --> 02:30.200
So first let's see if we have some uh some stars in the OR UM to do that we will use.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.520
Comments get stars.

02:32.900 --> 02:33.900
No shadows.

02:34.030 --> 02:41.510
The least we get to lists.

02:42.090 --> 02:42.640
Uh yeah.

02:42.660 --> 02:43.660
We don't uh.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.000
We don't.

02:46.170 --> 02:48.420
And it tells us that there is a star.

02:48.810 --> 02:51.420
So it's committed of joining us.

02:52.470 --> 03:00.960
So now if we want to uh jury see what each was an update which is uh we were right.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.590
Come on get us both.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.030
We committed.

03:07.260 --> 03:15.030
And as we see the thing that we we didn't commit to combat or the things that we stars or paused to

03:15.030 --> 03:21.990
give it so that we can give it fine to the to the other program or to the lead.

03:22.020 --> 03:25.260
It's now but again so now we can continue working.

03:25.260 --> 03:33.490
But it tells us that it um originally for Chile has been modified so we will know we will.

03:33.490 --> 03:35.770
Committed committed.

03:36.130 --> 03:36.860
Um.

03:37.130 --> 03:40.620
It hit me.

03:40.830 --> 03:41.700
Gosh.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.650
Um.

03:43.580 --> 03:49.850
Let's say I meet up to stash.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.770
Hit enter.

03:52.090 --> 03:57.380
Now check if everything or go fine with it.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.500
Just Hey Ginger.

04:00.600 --> 04:00.900
Yeah.

04:00.900 --> 04:01.950
Everything worked fine.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.620
So it's all for this video.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.200
You saw.
